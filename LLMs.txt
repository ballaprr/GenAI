What is LLMs?

A large language model is a trained deep learning model that understands and generate text in a human like fashion. 

LLMs are good at Understanding and generating model language

Why we call it Large Language Model?

Because of the size and complexity of the Neural Network as well as the size of the
dataset that it was trained on.

Researchers started to make these models large and trained on huge datasets

That they started showing impressive results like understanding complex Natural Language and generating
language and generating language more eloquently than ever.
