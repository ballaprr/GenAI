What is LLMs?

A large language model is a trained deep learning model that understands and generate text in a human like fashion. 

LLMs are good at Understanding and generating model language

Why we call it Large Language Model?

Because of the size and complexity of the Neural Network as well as the size of the
dataset that it was trained on.

Researchers started to make these models large and trained on huge datasets

That they started showing impressive results like understanding complex Natural Language and generating
language and generating language more eloquently than ever. 

Transfer learning -- Using existing model

Large Language models are based on transformer a type of Neural Network

What makes LLM so Powerful?

- In case of LLM, one model can be used for a whole variety of tasks like:
    Text generation, Chatbot, summarizer, translation, code generation & so on

So, LLM is subset of Deep Learn & it has some properties merge with Generative AI


Few milestone in Large Language Model

- Gemini from Google: 

- GPT: GPT stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer". The model was developed by OpenAI

- XLM: Cross-lingual Language Model Pretraining by Guillaume Lample, Alexis Conneau

- Llama: It was created by Meta AI

- Megatraon: Megatraon is a large, power transformer developed by the Applied Deep Learning Research team at NVIDIA

- M2M-100: multilingual encode-decoder (seq-to-seq) model researchers at Facebook

What can LLms be used for:
- Text Clasification, Generation, Summarization
- Conversation AI like Chatbot, Question Answering
- Speech recognition and Speech Identification
- Spelling Corrector


Prompt Designing:

All the text that we feed into an LLM as input is called a prompt and this whole art if known as prompt design, which is about
figuring out how to write and format prompt text to get LLMs to do what you want

"It's raining cats and"

"I have two appled and I eat one, I', left with"

The appraoch using a single command to get an LLM to take on a behavior is called Zero Shot Learning

"Write me a poem about Ada Lovelace in the style of Shakespeare"

"Explain the Quantum Physics to me like I'm five years old"
Quatume physics is the study of matter and energy at the most fundamental level. It aims to uncover the properties and behaviors of the
very building blocks 


Few Shot Learning:
In addition, to just providing an instruction it can be helpful to show the model what you want by adding examples this is called
few shot learning because we showed the model a few examples 

Like here is a prompt for translating from English to French
First, we prove an instruction as shown below:
Convert the text from English to French
Then we give some examples establishing the text pattern

Ex: Convert the text from Enligh to French 
Context:
Peppermint: menthe poivree
Desert cactus: Cactus du Desert
Lipstick: Rouge a levres

Output:
Orange Juice: du jus d'Orange
Sparkling water: Eau gazeuse
